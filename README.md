# Email Bulk Delete

This Python program is my first program to come to fruition  
Uses a variety of imported libraries to load in emails from the specified email address  
And deletes a large number of emails

This program does not delete all emails relating to email address however  
And only uses Gmail accounts

IMAP settings must be allowed in the account, and options that allow auto-expunge off, and move messages to the bin

Program also allows email addresses to be chained together so that many emails from different email addresses can be deleted

Help option in GUI gives additional information

If I had done this again, I would further split the GUI file into just the main menu, branching off into the actual methods used
